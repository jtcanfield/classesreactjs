// CLASSES PROJECT
// In this project, you will build a Mazda car factory that manufactures both cars and trucks.
// Read each set of instructions carefully!

// BUILD YOUR FACTORY!

// DECLARE A FACTORY CLASS
// All automobiles manufacutered should have the following properties: make (Mazda), location (USA), airbags (true), abs (true), warranty (60,000 miles / 3 years)
// This factory should also run two functions: massBuild() and customerBuild()

// massBuild should receive the following parameters: quantity, options.
// It should print "Building QUANTITY COLOR TRIM MODEL's" i.e: "Building 100 blue Touring CX-5's"

// customerBuild should receive the following parameters: color, options.
// It should print "Building one COLOR TRIM MODEL with the following options: OPTIONS", i.e: "Building one red Sport Mazda3 with the following options: heated seats, rear spoiler"

// Create the Factory class bellow:




// CREATE A SUB-CLASS CALLED CAR
// It should extend from Factory.
// The constructor should have the following properties: model, doors, color, enginetype, transmission, trim, wheelstrim, audio, seatstrim, moonroof. The values should be specified when creating an instance of Car.
// It should specifically inherit the warranty property from Factory so we can modify it.
// Car should also have the following additional properties: enginesize (4), navigation (true), backupcamera (true), warranty (100,000 miles / 5 years)
// Write your code below:




// CREATE A SUB-CLASS CALLED SPORT
// It should extend from Car.
// The constructor should have the following properties: model, trim, transmission, top, color, seatstrim, audio, wheelstrim. The values should be specified when creating an instance of Sport.
// Sports cars should also have the following additional properties: moonroof (false), enginetype (gasoline), convertible (true), doors (2)
// Write your code below:




// CREATE A SUB-CLASS CALLED TRUCK
// Yes...this Mazda factory makes trucks....
// It should extend from 'Factory'.
// The constructor should have the following properties: model, color, enginesize, hitch, bed, navigation. The values should be specified when creating an instance of Truck.
// Truck should also have the following properties, standard: backupcamera (true), audio (basic)
// It should also inherit the warranty property so we can extend it to: 150,000 miles / 6 years.
// Write your code below:




// LET'S BUILD SOME CARS AND TRUCKS!

// MAZDA3 MASS PRODUCTION
// Create an instance  Car.
// The following properties must be specified: model (mazda3), color (red), enginetype (hybrid), transmission (automatic), trim (touring), wheels (base), audio (premium), seats (leather), and moonroof (true)

// Write your 'mazda3' instance below:


// Print mazda3. I should have all the above properties.
// Write your code below:





// Print calling massBuild(), building 35000 cars.
// It should print: "Building 35000 Red Touring Mazda3's."
// Write your code below:





// Print, calling customerBuild(), building one yellow mazda3 with the following options, as an array: weather package, satellite radio, rear spoiler.
// It should read: "Building one yellow Touring Mazda3 with the following options: weather package, satellite radio, rear spoiler"
// Write your code below:





// MIATA-RF MASS PRODUCTION
// Create an instance  Sport.
// The following properties must be specified: model (Miata-RF), trim (Grand Touring), transmission (manual),  top (hard top), color (red), seats (leather), audio (premium), wheels (premium).

// Write your 'miataRf' instance below:
// Write your code below:





// Print miataRf. It should have all of the above properties. Plus, the extended warranty.
// Write your code below:





// Print miataRf, calling massBuild(), building 15,000
// It should print: "Building 15000 Red Grand Touring Miata-RF's."
// Write your code below:





// Print miataRf, calling customerBuild(), building one black Miata-Rf with the following options, as an array: hid headlights, sports suspension, leather steering wheel, heated seats, adaptive cruise control.
// It should read: "Building one black Grand Touring Miata-RF with the following options: hid headlights, sports suspension, leather steering wheel, heated seats, adaptive cruise control"
// Write your code below:




// TRAIL BLAZER MASS PRODUCTION
// The Trail Blazer should inherit from truck.
// The following properties must be specified: model (Trail Blazer), color (blue), trim (Sport), enginesize (8), hitch (true), bed (standard), navigation (true), doors (2)

// Write your 'trailBlazer' instance below:
// Write your code below:





// Print trailBlazer. It should have all the above properties. Plus, the extended warranty.
// Write your code below:




// Print trailBlazer, calling massBuid(). It should build 35000 trucks.
// It should print: "Building 35000 blue Sport Trail Blazer's."
// Wrint your code below:





// Print trailBlazer, calling customerBuild(). It should build a red Trail Blazer with the following options, as an array: seat warmers, tinted windows, fog lamps.
// It should print: "Building one red Sport Trail Blazer with the following options: seat warmers, tinted windows, fog lamps"
// Write your code below:
